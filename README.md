# Landing-Page
The Odin Project "Landing Page" project.

# About
This project represents the "Landing Page" project as part of The Odin Project.
This page is built only using HTML and CSS, along with an image. The goal of this project
was to duplicate a website layout we were given. We were given two images: one image of the finished product and the other image showing the styling used to make the page. From here, it was up to us
to make the finished landing page.
